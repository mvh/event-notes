Summary
=======

A series of slides describing how to scale up to 'web scale'.  Most of
the talk addresses fairly standard scale up approaches - up to and
including sacrificing some reliability for scale.

The novel work at the end describes sending redundant UDP packets to
multiple collectors in order to provide maximal data processing.
