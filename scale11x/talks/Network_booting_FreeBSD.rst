Summary
=======

Presentation on advanced pxe booting and configuration of FreeBSD.
I'm a longtime FreeBSD user so this was of interest to me.  Basically,
PC-BSD has developed boot up scripts similar to those available with
Linux that allows pxe boot, setup and install of system with advanced
configuraion options.
