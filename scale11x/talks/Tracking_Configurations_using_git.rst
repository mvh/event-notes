Summary
=======

Discussion of use of GIT to manage configurations.  git is usable to
keep track of /etc/ directory and other configuration issues as it
allows sparse trees.  Presenter had mid-level git experience - he is
using submodules, but not subtrees, which are a newer and preferred
way to deal with the same issue (code shared between projects).
