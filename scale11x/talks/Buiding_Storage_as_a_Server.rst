Summary
=======

Discusses building persistence into an OpenStack cloud.  I was
primarily interested in feedback or opinions on Gluster and Ceph, but
the presenter did not have much experience with them.

Learned about Swift, the OpenStack cloud object storage, which may
also be useful along with these stacks.
